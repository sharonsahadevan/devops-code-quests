# DevOps Coding Challenges

Welcome to **DevOps Coding Challenges**—a collection of practical coding problems and solutions tailored for DevOps engineers. This repo pairs with my newsletter, where I drop weekly challenges in **Python** and **Golang** to help you sharpen your automation, scripting, and systems skills.

## What’s This About?
Every week, I share a real-world DevOps scenario in my newsletter—think log parsing, container monitoring, or load testing. You solve it, share your approach with `#DevOpsChallenge` on Twitter, and find my solution here a week later. It’s hands-on learning for the tools and tasks you face daily.

## Challenges
Solutions are organized by language and challenge name. Check back weekly for updates!
